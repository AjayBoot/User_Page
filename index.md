### A little about me.

##### Introduction

Hello! This is my third year here at UCSD, where I’m majoring in computer engineering in Sixth College. My interest in pursuing a degree in computer engineering comes from spending time building my own desktop and my initial curiosity of becoming a software developer. Now, I aspire to focus more on embedded systems and possibly continue onto things like circuit design. Eventually, I hope to work in different parts of the country, and maybe even relocate to other countries for a while.

As a programmer, I tend to really enjoy using keyboard as much as I can as opposed to having to reach over for my mouse. In my CSE lower divs, I enjoyed learning all of the vim keyboard shortcuts so that I wouldn't have to reach over and use my mouse. Even for this lab, I preferred inputting the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands rather than using VSCode's UI. In this case, it allowed me to get a more concrete understanding for how to interact with github, but I also feel more productive typing things out as opposed to clicking on them.

##### Video Games

I currently live in the Bay Area, where I spend most of my time watching shows on netflix or youtube, and playing video games. I’ve played and enjoyed many different genres of video games, from strategy games like *Civilization V*, to MOBAs like *League of Legends*, and FPS games like *Counter Strike : Global Offensive*. Currently, I'd rank my favorite games as:

1. XCOM2
2. Borderlands 3
3. Risk of Rain 2
4. Battlefield V
5. Valorant
6. Street Fighter V

But honestly, it really depends on what my friends are playing, since I have a lot of fun playing with multiplayer games with other people as much as I enjoy single-player games.

##### Books

Before COVID, I would often go rock climbing at the [rec gym](https://recreation.ucsd.edu/adventures/climbing-center/) on campus. Now, since the gyms are closed, I’ve spent time reading books once again. Some of my favorite books include:

- The Wheel of Time series
- Unbroken
- The Life of Pi

Unbroken was a particularly inspirational novel for me as I read through all of the adverseries that Louis Zamperini faced. a particular quote resonated with me pretty often:

> "One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory"

Although this quote might be better applied to more extreme situations, it's motivating to apply it to everyday situations. Putting the hardwork and effort now will only lead to a more beneficial future. 

##### Goals

I have many goals for myself that I set for myself during the pandemic. Some of them include:

- [x] Finish the Wheel of Time
- [ ] Run/Rock climb on a regular schedule
- [ ] Learn to read/write Punjabi
- [ ] Get better at cooking
- [ ] Start a personal project
- [x] Don't get COVID
- [x] Stay on top of my classes

The last goal of staying on top of my classes was especially difficult and important to me. It was been hard to have the motivation to do much at all throughout the pandemic. However, I've been taking it one step at a time and been getting my work done on time.
